You can use this free [SQL Injection Scanner](http://www.mavitunasecurity.com/communityedition/) if you need a simple automated tool to detect SQL Injections.


# Dependencies #
It requires [.NET Framework 3.5 SP1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=AB99342F-5D1A-413D-8319-81DA479AB0D7) and possibly won't work with Mono.

Internally WebRaider uses Metasploit. We use a specific version of Metasploit. We trim the fat from Metasploit to launch it faster and make it smaller. You can change the paths and make it work with the latest Metasploit of your own setup.


# Antiviruses #
Your antivirus won't like the WebRaider download package as it includes reverse shell executables and other metasploit files.

# Sponsorship #
Web Raider is sponsored by [Netsparker - False-Positive Free Web Application Security Scanner](http://www.mavitunasecurity.com/netsparker/) and developed by the members of Netsparker Security Research Team.
